//In JavaScript, DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation describes the process of interacting with a web page's structure, content, and display. A web page's hierarchical structure is represented by the DOM as a tree of objects, where each object represents a page element.To access, alter, and manipulate DOM elements and their characteristics, JavaScript offers properties and methods. By altering the content, design, and behavior of elements based on user interactions or other events, developers may create dynamic and interactive web pages.
